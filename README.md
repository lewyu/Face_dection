【Abstract】In recent years, various target detection and recognition technologies have been popularized in many application scenarios, and the main reason is that computer vision continues to make new breakthroughs. Among them, face detection and recognition technology is widely used in security, finance and other industries. In this paper, the development history of face recognition and the status quo at home and abroad are introduced in detail. Finally, the deep learning framework TensorFlow is used in the Python integrated development tool Pycharm. Based on the MTCNN/FaceNet/OpenCV environment, the face recognition and online detection system is designed and implemented. The face online detection module is implemented by the MTCNN model, and then the FaceNet model is used to compare and recognize the detected faces to realize the face recognition function.

【Key words】 Face recognition, Face detection, Deep learning.
